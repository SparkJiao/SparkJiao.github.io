## About Me

My name is Fangkai Jiao (焦方锴). I am a third-year PhD candidate at Nanyang Technological University and Institute of Infocomm Research (I<sup>2</sup>R), A*STAR, with [A*STAR SINGA Scholarship](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/Scholarships/for-graduate-studies/singapore-international-graduate-award-singa). I am fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Shafiq Joty](https://raihanjoty.github.io/), [Prof. Nancy F. Chen](https://sites.google.com/site/nancyfchen/home) and [Prof. Aixin Sun](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/axsun/). Before that, I obtained both my M.Eng. and B.Eng. degree from Shandong University in 2022 and 2019, respecitively, under the supervision of [Prof. Liqiang Nie](https://liqiangnie.github.io/). I also work closely with [Dr. Yangyang Guo](https://guoyang9.github.io/), [Dr. Zhiyang Teng](https://zeeeyang.github.io/) and [Zhengyuan Liu](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=tqzidGsAAAAJ&hl=en). 

Previsouly, I have interned at CoAI Lab, Tsinghua University, mentored by [Prof. Minlie Huang](https://coai.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/hml); DAMO Academy, Alibaba Group, mentored by [Dr. Feng Ji](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BxWZ-ZgAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Dr. Feng-Lin Li](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=xo_dfnMAAAAJ&hl=en), Langboat Technology, adivsed by [Yulong Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yFhYPuQAAAAJ) and [Dr. Ming Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=a0w5c0gAAAAJ&hl=en), and Microsoft Research, mentored by [Dr. Xingxing Zhang](https://xingxingzhang.github.io/).  

My primary research interest includes self/weak-supervised training and machine reasoning with large language models. I'm also one of the main contributors to [PandaLLM](https://github.com/dandelionsllm/pandallm) project.
